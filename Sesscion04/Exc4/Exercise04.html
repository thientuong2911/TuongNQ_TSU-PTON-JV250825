        <b>A website</b> (also written as a <b>web site</b>) is any <span class="textcolor-blue">web page</span>
        whose content
        is identified by a common <span class="textcolor-blue">domain name</span> and is published on at least one
        <span class="textcolor-blue">web server.</span>
        Websites are typically dedicated to a particular topic or purpose, such as news, education, commerce,
        entertainment, or <span class="textcolor-blue">social media. Hyperlinking</span> between web pages guides
        the
        navigation of the site, which often starts with a <span class="textcolor-blue">home page.</span> The
        <span class="textcolor-blue">most-visited</span> sites are <span class="textcolor-blue">Google,
            YouTube</span>, and
        <span class="textcolor-blue">Facebook.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        All publicly-accessible websites collectively constitute the <span class="textcolor-blue">World Wide
            Web.</span> There
        are also <span class="textcolor-blue">private websites</span> that can only be accessed on a private
        network, such as a
        company's internal website for its employees. Users can access websites on a range of devices, including
        <span class="textcolor-blue">desktops, laptops, tablets,</span> and <span
            class="textcolor-blue">smartphones.</span> The <span class="textcolor-blue">app
            used on these devices is called a <span class="textcolor-blue">web browser</span>.
